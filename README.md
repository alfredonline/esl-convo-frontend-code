ESLConvo is a website for teachers of English as a foreign language. ESLConvo hosts conversation questions for teachers who want to have 
better conversation classes. The app also connects to an express app backend which sends back to the frontend synonyms of vocabulary 
as well as definition. You can submit questions to add to the app via Twitter @esl_convo."# esl-convo-frontend-code"
